# FlashCards
A randomized flash card study assistant.

# About
For studying, my girlfriend wanted a portable, easily accessible version of her flash cards.
Using my own prior knowledge, the fundamentals learned in my bootcamp course and with GitHub Copilot, I came up with a simple application to do that.

# Sources
Everything was forged with my brain cells and Copilot. Except of course for this medical stuff that I don't understand. That was her.
However, I did find this site nice for a color scheme:

# Use
Simply put, press the Start button to begin!
A random flash card will be presented with a button to alternate between the front and back of the card.
Click New Card to recieve another random card!
The Previous and Next buttons will iterate through the cards object in a linear fashion.
Don't worry if you are at the beginning or the end! The object array will loop so that you can continue.
